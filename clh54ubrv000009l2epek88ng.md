## What is Open Source?

Open source is a software development model that allows developers all across the world to access, share and improve/enhance the code used to build the software. It's more of a collaborative project that brings developers together and builds a community that eventually leads to constant improvement in the softwares. And it enables the developers to unleash their creativity and add new features to the existing software.

Some of the famous open-source software are [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) etc. Platforms such as [Github](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) *(also called version control tools)* etc are used for hosting the source code of the software, to which the developers can contribute.

### Prerequisites for Open Source:

**Basic coding skills:** To be able to contribute, you should have basic knowledge of coding fundamentals and should be able to write code in at least one programming language.

**Knowledge of Version control tools:** As discussed above, Open source software uses version control tools to host their source code. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) are the most widely used version control tools. So you should be familiar with the functioning of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com).

**Understanding of the community:** One of the key features of open-source is the community. Understanding the community, code of conduct, and communication methods are essential to ensure smooth and effective collaboration.

**Good communication skills:** Open source contributions typically involve collaboration with other developers. So the ability to ask questions and work together as part of a team is important.

**Most important:** Having a passion for development is essential. You have to find a driving force that keeps you motivated to continue your journey as a developer.

## Benefits of Open Source Contribution:

**Personal growth:** Contributing to open source can help you learn new skills and gain valuable experience in software development, project management, and collaboration.

**Networking:** Contributing to open source allows you to connect with other developers and experts in your field, which can lead to new opportunities and collaborations.

**Community building:** Contributing to open source can help you become part of a vibrant and supportive community.

**Social impact:** Open source software can have a positive social impact by making technology more accessible and affordable, and contributing to open source allows you to be part of this movement.
